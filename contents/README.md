Online help is set of .md files at <https://github.com/Nodeclipse/org.nodeclipse.help/tree/master/contents>

One topic is one .md file:
 <./configuration.md>, <./run.md>, <./debug.md>, <./coffeescript.md>, <./typescript.md>, <./plugins.md> .
`.html` files are generated and are not intended for edit. 

If you happened to explain to a colleague how to use Nodeclipse, this is the destination to check.
