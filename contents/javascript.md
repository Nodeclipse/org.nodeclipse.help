Title:  Nodeclipse Online Help - JavaScript  



## JavaScript

>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in server-side programming, game development and the creation of desktop applications.
